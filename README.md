### Example Translation Prompt
The default prompt is optimized for LaTeX translation:
```
You are a professional translator. Translate the following LaTeX text from English to Spanish. 
- Do NOT translate any LaTeX commands, environments, or math expressions; only translate the human-readable text.
- Preserve all LaTeX formatting, commands, and structure exactly as in the original.
- Ensure the translation is accurate, natural, and uses fluent academic Spanish.
- If you encounter citations, references, or labels, keep them unchanged.
- Output only the translated LaTeX code.
```

You can customize this prompt to:
- Change target language
- Add specific translation instructions
- Include domain-specific terminology
- Modify translation style or tone
